                            Game Plot
                        </h2>
                        <p>The entire action of the game takes place in some medieval Kingdom. At the beginning of the game, there are actually two separate plot lines that quickly converge into one. The first is the death of the king who ruled the Kingdom, and after his death, others appeared, but only for a short time. The lust for power led to chaos, and the artifacts that brought harmony - including The Trine - were vulnerable to theft. Hence, the Guardians of the Artifacts, appointed by the old king, surrounded the sanctuary of the Astral Academy - a place where knights and wizards were trained - with powerful protective spells. Only a person with a pure heart could get to them. The Guardians died soon, The Trine was the only one not stolen. The theft led to the distortion of magic and nature by Evil. Huge crowds of undead rose from the graves, spreading fear and destruction. The second thread is the expedition of three heroes, whom we meet at the beginning of the game. They are a thief, a wizard, and a knight. For various reasons, they all appeared at the sanctuary one night, but it is certain that it was the surviving artifact that summoned them. Their souls are merged into one, and their bodies become only their reflections. The Trine entrusts them with a mission to save themselves and the Kingdom. In doing so, they take over responsibility for the Artifacts, becoming the new Guardians, which can be seen as a merging of two plot lines into one.</p>
