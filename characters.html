            <p>The games in the <strong><a href="eng.html" title="Main website">Trine</a></strong> series are fantasy platformers developed by Finnish company <a href="https://www.frozenbyte.com" class="firma" target="_blank"><strong>FrozenByte</strong></a> and set in medieval times. They require the player to think logically when overcoming obstacles or enemies, as the three key characters in the game have different skills and attributes. " The Trine " is the first game in the series and is the focus of this website. You can find out more, Dear Reader, below. Enjoy your reading ðŸ¤—</p>

Excellent in her profession, as evidenced by the nickname she gained. Her next goal is a treasure hidden in the sanctuary of the Astral Academy, where magicians and warriors have been trained for centuries. The treasure turns out to be one of the magical Artifacts responsible for harmony in the Kingdom - the Triad. It was he who summoned her and connected her soul and the souls of two other heroes into one.</p>

Concerned for his life he decided to escape and joined the thief, attracted by the light coming from inside the temple.

                        <p>The Undead Army are human skeletons that rose from their graves as a result of the theft of two Artifacts, which brought chaos and evil to the Kingdom, which was reflected in magic and nature. They are:</p>

It is best to hit these skeletons from a long distance with arrows or quickly jump at them and defeat them with a series of sword cuts. They are slightly less dangerous than <strong>other creatures</strong>.</p>
