It is visible that their magnificence lies mainly in the originality of the creators, rather than in modeling themselves on the beauty of nature. This is a confirmation of the intention regarding the plot of the entire game, which tells about the corruption of nature and magic by Evil, which reigned in the Kingdom as a result of the theft of two Artifacts, which disturbed the harmony. Controlling a thief, knight or wizard, we get to places such as:</p>

After dealing with the starting package of death, the premium version awaits us - whole hordes of skeletons gaping and chopping and bats, constantly bothering us with their attacks from the sky. And Sarek, whenever we clear our way to the very top, where we separate the souls of our heroes and return all the Artifacts, sends us more obstacles. The game ends when, despite everything, we manage, and the king of Evil and monsters gets hit in the head with a knight's hammer üòÉ</p>
